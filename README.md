### Project name:

NutriologyPie

### How to run with localhost:

Because the framework of NutriologyPie was built before, you can directly **git pull** the repository to your local device.
But some steps need to be followed before running the website on your localhost:

- Step 1: Download the **Xampp** and install it: https://www.apachefriends.org/
- Step 2: Use **"git clone"** to clone the project **directly** into the path: xampp/htdocs/....
- Step 3: Use the xampp interface and start "Apache" and "MySql" Module
  Now you can use " http://localhost/NutriologyPie/login " to run your project
